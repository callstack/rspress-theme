React Native needs to run additional JS setup/init code so that it's usable at all. There's a great discrepancy between available APIs. In React Native we also have platform specific files — e.g.: .ios.js, .android.js and so on.\n\nPutting all the above together, makes webpack unable to produce bundle at all due to build errors and then the bundle produced by webpack is unusable by default.\n\nTherefore, we need to make changes to webpack configuration and change how and what webpack puts into the final bundle. All these necessary changes are encapsulated inside Re.Pack in form of webpack plugins.\n\nSo to answer the question:\n\n:::info Re.Pack is what makes webpack and webpack-produced bundle usable in React Native application.\n:::\n\n## Tabs\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab label=\"first tab\">npm</Tab>\n  <Tab label=\"second tab\">\n    ```bash title=\"codeblock\"\n    npm install rspress -D\n    ```\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n## Package Manager Tabs\n\n<PackageManagerTabs command=\"install rspress -D\" />\n\n## Example Table\n\nHere is a simple markdown table:\n\n| Name  | Age | City          |\n| ----- | --- | ------------- |\n| Alice | 24  | New York      |\n| Bob   | 29  | San Francisco |\n| Carol | 32  | Chicago       |\n\n## Inline Code Block\n\n`npm install rspress -D`\n\n## Code Block\n\n```\nnpm install rspress -D\n```\n\n## Code Block with Highlight\n\n```ts title=codeblock.ts {1,3}\nconst a = 1;\nconst b = 2;\nconst c = 3;\nconst d = 4;\n```\n\n## Container cases\n\n:::info\n\nThe command is started through the React Native Community CLI's `start` command, which is overridden [inside `react-native.config.js`]() to spawn Re.Pack's dev server.\n\n:::\n\n:::warning This plugin is primarily intended for Rspack users.\n\nThe main purpose of this plugin is to limit the **build performance impact** of the `react-native-reanimated` babel plugin.\nIf you're using webpack with `babel-loader`, you probably don't need this plugin. Instead, you should follow the [official Reanimated documentation]() and add the Reanimated Babel plugin directly to your `babel.config.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  presets: [\"module:@react-native/babel-preset\"],\n  plugins: [\"react-native-reanimated/plugin\"],\n};\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::danger Platform-Specific Output\nBy default, extracted asset files are copied to `assets/` directory for iOS and `drawable-*` directories (e.g. `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-hdpi`, etc.) for Android which matches Metro's asset handling behavior.\n\n1.

You can link to a section, such as [Use Component]().\n\n## Markdown\n\nMDX is a superset of Markdown, which means you can write Markdown files as usual. For example:\n\n```md\n# Hello World\n```\n\n## Use Component\n\nWhen you want to use React components in Markdown files, you should name your files with `.mdx` extension. For example:\n\n```mdx\n// docs/index.mdx\n\n\n# Hello World\n\n<CustomComponent />\n```\n\n## Front Matter\n\nYou can add Front Matter at the beginning of your Markdown file, which is a YAML-formatted object that defines some metadata. For example:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: Hello World\n---\n```\n\n> Note: By default, Rspress uses h1 headings as html headings.\n\nYou can also access properties defined in Front Matter in the body, for example:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Hello World\n---\n\n# {frontmatter.title}\n```\n\nThe previously defined properties will be passed to the component as `frontmatter` properties. So the final output will be:\n\n```html\n<h1>Hello World</h1>\n```\n\n## Custom Container\n\nYou can use the `:::` syntax to create custom containers and support custom titles. For example:\n\n**Input:**\n\n```markdown\n:::note\nThis is a `block` of type `note`\n:::\n\n:::tip\nThis is a `block` of type `tip`\n:::\n\n:::info\nThis is a `block` of type `info`\n:::\n\n:::warning\nThis is a `block` of type `warning`\n:::\n\n:::danger\nThis is a `block` of type `danger`\n:::\n\n::: details\nThis is a `block` of type `details`\n:::\n\n:::tip Custom Title\nThis is a `block` of `Custom Title`\n:::\n\n:::tip{title=\"Custom Title\"}\nThis is a `block` of `Custom Title`\n:::\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n:::note\nThis is a `block` of type `note`\n:::\n\n:::tip\nThis is a `block` of type `tip`\n:::\n\n:::info\nThis is a `block` of type `info`\n:::\n\n:::warning\nThis is a `block` of type `warning`\n:::\n\n:::danger\nThis is a `block` of type `danger`\n:::\n\n::: details\nThis is a `block` of type `details`\n:::\n\n:::tip Custom Title\nThis is a `block` of `Custom Title`\n:::\n\n:::tip{title=\"Custom Title\"}\nThis is a `block` of `Custom Title`\n:::\n\n## Code Block\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nYou can use the \\`\\`\\` syntax to create code blocks and support custom titles. For example:\n\n**Input:**\n\n````md\n```js\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n```\n\n```js title=\"hello.js\"\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n```\n````\n\n**Output:**\n\n```js\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n```\n\n```js title=\"hello.js\"\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n```\n\n### Show Line Numbers\n\nIf you want to display line numbers, you can enable the `showLineNumbers` option in the config file:\n\n```ts title=\"rspress.config.ts\"\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  markdown: {\n    showLineNumbers: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Wrap Code\n\nIf you want to wrap long code line by default, you can enable the `defaultWrapCode` option in the config file:\n\n```ts title=\"rspress.config.ts\"\nexport default {\n  // ...\n  markdown: {\n    defaultWrapCode: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Line Highlighting\n\nYou can also apply line highlighting and code block title at the same time, for example:\n\n**Input:**\n\n````md\n```js title=\"hello.js\" {1,3-5}\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n\nconst a = 1;\n\nconsole.log(a);\n\nconst b = 2;\n\nconsole.log(b);\n```\n````\n\n**Ouput:**\n\n```js title=\"hello.js\" {1,3-5}\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n\nconst a = 1;\n\nconsole.log(a);\n\nconst b = 2;\n\nconsole.log(b);\n```\n\n## Rustify MDX compiler\n\nYou can enable Rustify MDX compiler by following config:\n","routePath":"/test/guide","lang":"en","toc":[{"id":"markdown","text":"Markdown","depth":2,"charIndex":143},{"id":"use-component","text":"Use Component","depth":2,"charIndex":277},{"id":"front-matter","text":"Front Matter","depth":2,"charIndex":483},{"id":"custom-container","text":"Custom Container","depth":2,"charIndex":1052},{"id":"code-block","text":"Code Block","depth":2,"charIndex":2056},{"id":"basic-usage","text":"Basic Usage","depth":3,"charIndex":2071},{"id":"show-line-numbers","text":"Show Line Numbers","depth":3,"charIndex":2408},{"id":"wrap-code","text":"Wrap Code","depth":3,"charIndex":2645},{"id":"line-highlighting","text":"Line Highlighting","depth":3,"charIndex":2884},{"id":"rustify-mdx-compiler","text":"Rustify MDX compiler","depth":2,"charIndex":3285}],"frontmatter":{},"version":"","description":"Rspress supports not only Markdown but also MDX, a powerful way to develop content.
