# Hello World!

Before diving deep into Re.Pack and introducing it into project, it's important to understand when and why to use Re.Pack and how does it compare with alternatives.

## What `@callstack/repack` actually is?

React Native environment and Browser environment have differences. React Native needs to run additional JS setup/init code so that it's usable at all. There's a great discrepancy between available APIs. In React Native we also have platform specific files — e.g.: .ios.js, .android.js and so on.

Putting all the above together, makes webpack unable to produce bundle at all due to build errors and then the bundle produced by webpack is unusable by default.

Therefore, we need to make changes to webpack configuration and change how and what webpack puts into the final bundle. All these necessary changes are encapsulated inside Re.Pack in form of webpack plugins.

So to answer the question:

:::info Re.Pack is what makes webpack and webpack-produced bundle usable in React Native application.

## Package Manager Tabs


```sh [npm]

## Example Table

Here is a simple markdown table:

| Name  | Age | City          |
| ----- | --- | ------------- |
| Alice | 24  | New York      |
| Bob   | 29  | San Francisco |

## Code Block with Highlight

```ts title=codeblock.ts {1,3}
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = 3;
const d = 4;
```

## Container cases

:::info

The command is started through the React Native Community CLI's `start` command, which is overridden [inside `react-native.config.js`](/rspress-theme/pr-preview/pr-108/index.md) to spawn Re.Pack's dev server.

:::

:::warning This plugin is primarily intended for Rspack users.

The main purpose of this plugin is to limit the **build performance impact** of the `react-native-reanimated` babel plugin.
If you're using webpack with `babel-loader`, you probably don't need this plugin. Instead, you should follow the [official Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#step-2-add-reanimateds-babel-plugin) and add the Reanimated Babel plugin directly to your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ["module:@react-native/babel-preset"],
  plugins: ["react-native-reanimated/plugin"],
};
```

:::

:::danger Platform-Specific Output
By default, extracted asset files are copied to `assets/` directory for iOS and `drawable-*` directories (e.g. `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-hdpi`, etc.) for Android which matches Metro's asset handling behavior.

# Markdown & MDX

Rspress supports not only Markdown but also [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a powerful way to develop content. You can link to a section, such as [Use Component](#use-component).

## Markdown

MDX is a superset of Markdown, which means you can write Markdown files as usual. For example:

```md
# Hello World
```

## Use Component

When you want to use React components in Markdown files, you should name your files with `.mdx` extension. For example:

```mdx
// docs/index.mdx
import { CustomComponent } from './custom';

# Hello World

<CustomComponent />
```

## Front Matter

You can add Front Matter at the beginning of your Markdown file, which is a YAML-formatted object that defines some metadata. For example:

```yaml
---
title: Hello World
---
```

> Note: By default, Rspress uses h1 headings as html headings.

You can also access properties defined in Front Matter in the body, for example:

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```

The previously defined properties will be passed to the component as `frontmatter` properties. So the final output will be:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

## Custom Container

You can use the `:::` syntax to create custom containers and support custom titles. For example:

**Input:**

```markdown
:::note
This is a `block` of type `note`
:::

:::tip
This is a `block` of type `tip`
:::

:::info
This is a `block` of type `info`
:::

:::warning
This is a `block` of type `warning`
:::

:::danger
This is a `block` of type `danger`
:::

::: details
This is a `block` of type `details`
:::

:::tip Custom Title
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

:::tip{title="Custom Title"}
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::
```

**Output:**

:::note
This is a `block` of type `note`
:::

:::tip
This is a `block` of type `tip`
:::

:::info
This is a `block` of type `info`
:::

:::warning
This is a `block` of type `warning`
:::

:::danger
This is a `block` of type `danger`
:::

::: details
This is a `block` of type `details`
:::

:::tip Custom Title
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

:::tip\{title="Custom Title"}
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

## Code Block

### Basic Usage

You can use the \`\`\` syntax to create code blocks and support custom titles. For example:

**Input:**

````md
```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World');
```
````

**Output:**

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World');
```

### Show Line Numbers

If you want to display line numbers, you can enable the `showLineNumbers` option in the config file:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
export default {
  // ...
  markdown: {
    showLineNumbers: true,
  },
};
```

### Wrap Code

If you want to wrap long code line by default, you can enable the `defaultWrapCode` option in the config file:

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
export default {
  // ...
  markdown: {
    defaultWrapCode: true,
  },
};
```

### Line Highlighting

You can also apply line highlighting and code block title at the same time, for example:

**Input:**

````md
```js title="hello.js" {1,3-5}
console.log('Hello World');

const a = 1;

console.log(a);

const b = 2;

console.log(b);
```
````

**Ouput:**

```js title="hello.js" {1,3-5}
console.log('Hello World');

const a = 1;

console.log(a);

const b = 2;

console.log(b);
```
